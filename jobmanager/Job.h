/**
Generic callable. The only restriction is that needs to implement operator()().
This is has some advantages over give a utils::function.

We can use the direct type returned by utils::bind which creates one less level of indirection as the result is a final
type and does not need to invoke more virtual methods We can use lambda functions directly. The lambda function itself
does not created dynamic memory (dynamic memory can happens when we transform the lambda on std::function).
