/*
Rate controlling is about modelling the network queue and propagation delay and use Receiver reports (RR) with RTT to
figure out what bandwidth best describes the observation. Typically, a packets travel time depends on three parameters:
- the size of the packet
- the bandwidth
- the size of the network queue at the time of insertion of packet
- the distance to the receiver

An RR contains information about which packet was last received and the time that has passed since the latest sender
report (SR). By tracking sent packets, we can calculate the receive rate in that window. We can also
calculate roughly the number of bytes still in transit. By modelling the network queue according to the expected
bandwidth, we assess if we were utilizing the link fully and the receive rate after the SR can guide us to the link
bandwidth. The probe receive rate is unreliable in that it can be highe rand lower than the actual through put. Also
there are multiple streams that send receiver reports at different points in time. The actual number of confirmed
received packets needs multiple receiver reports to establish. The confidence in the receive rate increases with the
number of packets confirmed and the time passed since the SR was received.

To get some useful data we need to probe the link by sending excess bandwidth over a short period of time.
This is done by interleaving the media packets with RTCP padding packets and Video RTX packets with old
sequence numbers. Both will be ignored by the receiver. To avoid packet loss this is done by filling the nework queue
and then maintain estimated bandwidth of the link. Either the bandwidth is correctly assessed and the network queue
remains after the probe, or it is higher and the receive rate is higher and the actual network queue is shorter than
predicted.
